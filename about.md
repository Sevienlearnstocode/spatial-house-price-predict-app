# About
This tool provides a detailed analysis of house pricing dynamics based on our research using advanced statistical models, such as the **Spatial Autoregressive Model (SAR)** and the **Spatial Error Model (SEM)**. By leveraging the best model between the two spatial dependency models stated, my app offers valuable insights into the spatial relationships and error dependencies inherent in housing data, helping users understand the complex factors influencing house prices.

Users can explore the modeling results of our research, which showcase the impact of variables like land area (Luas Tanah), building area (Luas Gedung), electricity power (Daya Listrik), and district (Kecamatan) on house prices. Through interactive visualizations and detailed reports, our application presents a comprehensive view of the housing market, empowering users with actionable information for real estate decisions.

#### What is Spatial Autoregressive Model (SAR)?
The Spatial Autoregressive Model (SAR) is a powerful statistical tool that analyzes spatial dependencies in house prices. It recognizes that properties near each other tend to influence each other's prices and captures this spatial interdependence through a spatial lag term. By incorporating geographic context into pricing analysis, the SAR model provides a nuanced understanding of how location impacts property values.

#### What is Spatial Error Model (SEM)?
The Spatial Error Model (SEM) addresses spatial autocorrelation in house price prediction by adjusting for spatially correlated error terms. It acknowledges the influence of unobserved factors on property values and improves prediction accuracy by correcting for spatial dependencies in the errors. This model offers insights into the indirect effects of spatially correlated variables on house prices, enhancing the depth of analysis in real estate decision-making.

By presenting the modeling results of the advanced statistical model, my web application equips users with a comprehensive view of house pricing dynamics, enabling informed decisions and strategic insights in the real estate market.
